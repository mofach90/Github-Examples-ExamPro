# Task 1: Create a Simple Workflow with Push Trigger
#     Objective: Create a workflow that runs automatically when you push code to your repository.
#     Steps:
#         Create a .github/workflows/main.yml file in your repository.
#         Define a workflow that runs on the push event.
#         Use the actions/checkout action from GitHub Marketplace to checkout your repository.
#         Add a simple step, such as running a shell command (echo), to confirm the workflow executes successfully.
#     Key Concepts: Workflow trigger, action from GitHub Marketplace.
